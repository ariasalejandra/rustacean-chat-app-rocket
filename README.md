Project Introduction: We hope to create a chap app/server with Rust with the use of other online tools. 
We wanted to make something out of our comfort zone to challenge ourselves to apply what we've learned in class and in past projects to what we could learn and utilize our skills to create a fun project. 
We would like to challenge ourselves and bet to make an app, however, for now we decided on a server due to time limiations.

Technical Overview: The creation of this technical website will require the use of frontend and backend devices. Based on references we found, some common devices are the rocket crate. We do not have any prior experience with these tools however, the interface does not seem to be complicated and we are determined to learn the framework in time to execute our chat server. After figuring out these tools, we plan to start on the front end, implementing how the server will look like as this would require some html skills. Afterwards we plan to work on the backend where the app will "do the work" as it interacts with the server. We are still unsure on the specific of this project as we are still trying to figure it out, but for now we plan on doing a simple chat server where you would create an account or log in, chat with friends or chat on public spaces, like a public forum open to anyone. If we have time, we would like to implement group chats with specific people, blocking users, deleting accounts, adding profile pictures, etc. For now, we will have the basics. For the first checkpoint, we plan to have most of the simple frotend almost complete after learning to work with yew.rs. After doing some research, we found that yew.rs is heavily inspired by React and web development fundamentals. For the second checkpoint, we plan to have the backend half completed, such as to have usernames and password functions completed and to be stored, have chats to be saved for when that user is logged on and hopefully figure out to have them saved for the next time they log in. The goal for now is to have chats to be saved and displayed for when a user is online. For the final delivery we plan to have a completed, simple, chat server and hopefully have implemented some additional features.

Possible Challenges: Since we do not have any prior experience in Rocket, it might slow down the progress of our chat server creation. We have to have a consistent schedule when working on our project to learn these materials to successfully work on our chat server. Another challenge is saving data, we are unsure how we will save user logins anc user chats, especially in the public chatroom so it might not work as intended.
