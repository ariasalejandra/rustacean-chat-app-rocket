Group Name: Crustacean Chat

Project Introduction: For our final project we have created a chap app and server with Rust and the inclusion of other helpful online tools. We have created a project that was out of our comfort zone and very challenging too. We successfully applied what we have learned in class and skill from past projects to create this fun chat app/server.

Technical Overview: The creation of this technical website will require the use of frontend and backend devices. Based on our research and reference from a Rust youtube creator we found, some common devices are yew.rs and axum.rs. However, for our project instead of doing the frontend and backend on different services we used one crate. The Rocket crate was much more efficient and understandable for us to use since we could handle the frontend and backend on that one crate. We did not have any prior experience with these tools however, we learned how to use the interface and framework in time to execute our chat server. After figuring out these tools, we started on the front end, implementing how the server looks as this required some html skills. Afterwards we worked on the backend where the app will "do the work" as it interacts with the server. This part was more difficult for us as we attempted our chat app/server implement services like creating an account, logging in, chatting with friends and chatting on public spaces, like a public forum open to anyone. If we have time, we would like to implement group chats with specific people, blocking users, deleting accounts, adding profile pictures, etc. For now, we have the basics. The frontend is completed and customized. The backend contains functions such having usernames and password functions being completed and stored, having chats be saved for when that user is logged on and having them saved for the next time they log in. The chat server is simple and completed.


Our Challenges: Since we do not have any prior experience in creating chat servers it was very intimidating to start this project. We ran into an issue of how to implement the frontend and backend because the two services we tried to use, axums.rs and yew.rs were very complicated to us. However, we resolved that issue by finding a Rocket crate. Using Rocket crate although limited us to creating the server only on a static website.
